# Score Keeper

## Description

A score keeping tool that can be used to keep track of two players scores for trivia. The application is designed so players can choose the winning number they are playing to. When the number is reached, the winner's score will be displayed in green and the loser's score will be displayed in red. At the end of the round users can hit reset and track their new scores all over again.

## Reflections

This project gave me the opportunity to practice the utilization of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and a new platform I was introduced to, BULMA. Building this tool allowed me to grapple with solution oriented thinking, visual structures, and the importance of making something work before refactoring. I imposed a timeframe of one to three days as a challenge to myself. I was thrilled that most features were functional on day one. While the completed project took a total of three days.

## Stretch Features

In the case of expanding this project, I would:
- Adjust player count with an additional drop down option that gives users the ability to choose how many players are participating. 
- Make the score keeper a feature of a larger game that includes trivia questions.

## Getting Started 

- Open terminal.
